# Throwback — My First Repository 

<img src="banner.svg" alt="add.cpp banner" style="max-width:100%;height:auto" />



This was my very first repository. I created it while learning basic `git` commands in the terminal. The repo started with the single file `add.cpp`, and I practiced the canonical workflow:

- `git add add.cpp`
- `git commit -m "initial commit"`
- `git push origin main`

Those simple commands are why this tiny program feels like a milestone 
it represents the moment I learned to track changes and share code.
